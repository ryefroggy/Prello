              <li><p>I sure hope it goes well</p></li>
              <li><p>I'm not sure how many of these it is going to take
                to make the scrollbar show</p></li>
              <li><p>Turns out that it is going to take a lot of text to reach the
                bottom of the page to actually witness the scrollbar in action.
                Which is a bummer because I really don't have many random things
                to type to fill up the space</p></li>
              <li><p>I actually know why there aren't a lot of females in CS.
                It is simply because it is a boy's club. It really isn't the fault
                of male programmers. It is more a societal thing. Girls don't feel
                welcome in the technology field. Just as boys tend to not grow up
                feeling comfortable playing with barbie dolls. It isn't feminine
                to program. It isn't feminine to work with technology</p></li>
              <li><p>This is slowly changing, of course. But it will definitely take
                time before women will be a larger part of the technology industry.
                I was lucky enough to grow up with a grandfather that is a computer
                engineer and a father that welcomed me to be a part of the boy's
                club</p></li>
              <li><p>It is the same with video games, as well. Though I would say
                that that is openning up slightly faster than CS is. Not to mention
                that women tend to go to more feminine jobs, like nursing.</p></li>
